# retro-web-elements

A collection of six HTML elements to revive the joys of web development in the 90s, built with Polymer.

- **`retro-basefont`**: The `\<basefont>` element.
- **`retro-bgsound`**: The `\<bgsound>` element. Uses jasmid to parse MIDI files in browsers that don't support this element natively (= everything not Internet Explorer). The sound quality leaves room for improvement.
- **`retro-blink`**: The `\<blink>` element.
- **`retro-counter`**: Creates a 90s-style visitor counter with a random value.
- **`retro-gif`**: Creates fake GIF animations (jumping, pulsating).
- **`retro-spacer`**: The `\<spacer>` element.

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) and npm (packaged with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) installed. Run `npm install` to install your element's dependencies, then run `polymer serve` to serve your element locally.
